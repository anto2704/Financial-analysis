# Cash Flow Crystal Ball - Predictive Liquidity in Construction

## 1 Introduction

The construction industry, valued at nearly two trillion U.S. dollars in 2023 and projected to reach 2.
trillion by 2027 [Dep25], faces persistent cash flow management challenges that directly affect project
success and business sustainability. The purpose of a cash flow statement is to provide a detailed
picture of cash inflows and outflows during a given period, reflecting a company’s short- and long-
term operational capability [Sto20]. According to the Construction Industry Institute, nearly 60% of
construction firms experience cash flow difficulties, leading to payment delays, project disruptions, and
even business closures [Far24]. Ineffective liquidity management and poor payment term alignment
often signal potential financial distress [Mar20].
We selected Saipem as the focal company after comparing its cash-flow dynamics with its competi-
tors. Saipem shows:

1. Volatility in operating cash flow (–477k in 2022 to 1,061k in 2024),
2. Weak operating cash-flow ratio (0.12 in 2024), far below Fluor’s ( 0.27)
3. Steep fall of cash balance from 2,136k (2023) to 1,410k (2024) while current liabilities rose to
    8,564k
4. Financing flows swung from +871k (2022) to –544k (2024)
    These patterns like large liabilities, declining cash reserves, volatile OCF and financing dependency
signal liquidity stress and make Saipem a high-impact candidate for a daily cash-flow forecasting
prototype (benchmarked against Fluor, 3rd Company).

## 2 Industry Dynamics and Liquidity Assessment

## 2.1 Construction Industry Problem Scope

The construction industry operates within a uniquely volatile financial environment characterized by
irregular cash inflows, improper inventory management, extended payment cycles, and unexpected
changes in projects. Unlike manufacturing or retail, construction projects depend on milestone-based
billing, progress certifications, and client approvals—factors that often delay receivables and cause liq-
uidity strain even in otherwise profitable firms.[PwC20] The sector’s capital-intensive structure further
complicates liquidity management. Contractors must commit substantial funds upfront for materi-
als, labor, and equipment before receiving client payments. This imbalance, combined with retention
clauses and pay-when-paid contracts, makes cash flow forecasting a critical determinant of survival
rather than merely profitability. Real-world cases, such as Carillion plc’s 2018 collapse in the UK,
highlight how aggressive revenue recognition and inadequate forecasting can lead to insolvency despite
strong order books [Gua18].
This is precisely why we chose the construction sector for our study: the cash-flow fragility inherent
to this industry presents both an urgent challenge and a vast opportunity. These mis-forecasts of daily
inflows and outflows ultimately slow national economic growth and disrupt public services. By apply-
ing a predictive cash-flow model at a smaller scale, construction companies can strengthen liquidity,
optimise working-capital cycles, and enhance operational resilience. In turn, this supports faster in-
frastructure delivery, improved industry stability, and broader contributions to national development
and competitiveness.
